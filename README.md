This is a test of my shell knowledge.
Here, I have built my own personal laptop on WINDOWS OS.

---A DESKTOP IS EITHER PERSONAL OR NOT---
A desktop might either be owned or operated by a single entity or by a body. A desktop operated by a single entity means only one person has full access to read, write and execute.
Although s is owned by a single person, the desktop could be modified into various aspects of the operator's activities, such as : SCHOOL, WORK, PERSONAL LIFE, etc.

NON-PERSONAL\n=============
While a personal desktop is operated by a single person with full R,W,X access, one owned or operated by a body is operated by numerous people. It could be an institution, organization or industry that allows several staff or individuals use a single laptop, thereby creating each user identity and desktop.
